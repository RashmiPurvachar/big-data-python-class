# Installation
Use Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Use the installer for windows, mac or linux. Be sure to use 2.7 python (Do not use 3.6 ) Our text books examples are in 2.7 and 3.x is not backward compatible.  

The download and installation will probably take some time. You are installing most of what you will need for this class.. ( I am trying the MS VSCode installation as well it comes on the Windows installer)

After the installation, find the packages installed

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started

You should be able to find:

-Jupyter notebook

-Visual Studio Code ( if you installed it)

-Spyder

-anaconda prompt

-ananconda navigator



##Python test
You should test to see that the correct python has been installed 

Run anaconda prompt and the > type the bolded commands:

(base) \your install directory\>  python

Python 2.7.15 |Anaconda Inc. | (default, May 1 2018, 18:37:09)  ......
>>> a=2
>>> a
2
>>> quit()
(base) \your install directory\>

##Jupyter Notebook

Next try out the jupyter notebook interface. 

Use ctrl-C to stop it

In the jupyter window:

Create a new folder:  

It will be named "Untitled Folder" select its checkbox and rename  it to:

Testing-python

click into this new directory and 

Create a new python 2 notebook and under file rename it Test1 . in the IN [1]: box enter:

In [1]: a=2
        a
Press ">| run" button The result should show as:

Out [1]: 2


##SPYDER

Now open spyder ( a python IDE that comes with anaconda ) Create a new python file with:

a=2
print a

press the run button. The output should show 2

after the runfile('path/nameofile.py', wdir='path/of/working/directory') is automatically invoked.

##Matplot test
In your jupyter file Test1 In[2] enter:

from matplotlib.pylab import *
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline
plot(np.arange(10)**2)
A graph should show up in your notebook.

You are now ready to rock the data world!
